A simple Mandrill webhook controller to help with email events. Useful for notifying users that you cannot reach them via email inside your application. Compatible with Laravel 5+ and Lumen 5+.

## Installation
```composer require eventhomes/laravel-mandrillhooks```

## Basic Usage

1) Create a controller that extends MandrillWebhookController as follows. You can then handle any Mandrillapp webhook event.
```php
use EventHomes\Api\Webhooks\MandrillWebhookController;

class MyController extends MandrillWebhookController {

    /**
     * Handle a hard bounced email
     *
     * @param $payload
     */
    public function handleHardBounce($payload)
    {
        $email = $payload['msg']['email'];
    }

    /**
     * Handle a rejected email
     *
     * @param $payload
     */
    public function handleReject($payload)
    {
        $email = $payload['msg']['email'];
    }
}
```

2) Create the route to handle the webhook. In your routes.php file add the following.
```php
post('mandrill-webhook', ['as' => 'mandrill.webhook', 'uses' => 'MandrillController@handleWebHook']);
```
3) [Exclude your route from CSRF protection](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/csrf#csrf-excluding-uris) so it will not fail.

4) Make sure you add your webhook in Mandrill to point to your route. You can do this here: https://mandrillapp.com/settings/webhooks

## (Optional) Webhook Authentication
If you would like to increase the security of the webhooks. Add the *MandrillWebhookServiceProvider* provider to the providers array in config/app.php

```php
'providers' => [
  ...
  EventHomes\Api\Webhooks\MandrillWebhookServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Next, publish the configuration via
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="EventHomes\Api\Webhooks\MandrillWebhookServiceProvider"
```
Simply add your Mandrill webhook key in the config file and requests will be authenticated.
